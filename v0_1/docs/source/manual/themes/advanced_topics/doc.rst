Change Line Width
===================

Changing line width might be popular modification for some of you.
We recommend to add new style name for standadize line width between images.
However you can modify it on the spot with ``<style-name>.<line-width-percentage>`` syntax.
For example, ``blue_solid.50`` makes half width line and ``blue_solid.200`` makes double.

Here is a example.

.. figure:: image_linewidth.png
    :width: 600
    :class: with-border
    :align: center

You can specify only int value after dot.
``blue_solid`` and ``blue_solid.100`` are same since 100% is original width.
