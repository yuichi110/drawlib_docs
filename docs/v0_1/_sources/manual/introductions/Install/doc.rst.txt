Install
===============

You can install drawlib with this command. If your system uses ``python3`` and ``pip3``, use them instead.

.. code-block:: none

   $ pip install drawlib

After install, you can check version with this command.

.. code-block:: none

   $ python -m drawlib --version
   software=0.1.1
   api=0.1.1

Not only software(library) version, you can see API version too.
It is because drawlib supports old API(previously released library's API) at new version for backward compatibility.
If you have interest, please check details in backward compatibility section.
